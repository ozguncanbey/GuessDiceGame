# GuessDiceGame

## Description
GuessDiceGame is an exciting iOS app that challenges players to guess the total of two randomly rolled dice. The game consists of two pages, providing an engaging and interactive experience for users. On the first page, players can select their guess using a slider, choosing a value between one and six. Once they are ready, they can press the "Start" button to proceed to the second page. On the second page, two dice are rolled, and the player is allowed to make guesses based on the number of guesses they have selected on the first page. The guessed value can be adjusted using arrows next to the input field, enabling the player to fine-tune their prediction. After making a guess, the game provides immediate feedback. If the guess is correct, the message "Correct" is displayed along with a "Play Again" button. If the guess is incorrect, the message "Wrong" appears, and the player can choose to try again by clicking the "Try Again" button. Pressing either "Play Again" or "Try Again" restarts the game. Additionally, players can return to the first page at any time to change the number of allowed guesses.
